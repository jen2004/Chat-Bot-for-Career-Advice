# Chat Bot for Career Advice

I completed this project during my 5th semester at WGU as a part of the class Introduction to Artificial Intelligence C951.

Careerbot is a chatbot designed to assist Computer Science students at Pumpkin Spice University in exploring potential career paths, alleviating the workload on career advisors due to increased enrollment. By leveraging AIML and hosted on the Pandorabots platform, Careerbot provides an intuitive, button-based interface to guide students through career-related questions, aligning their preferences and strengths with suitable job recommendations. The chatbot currently supports five roles: Data Analyst, Software Engineer, Video Games Developer, UX Designer, and Cybersecurity Engineer, offering tailored suggestions with links to further resources.
